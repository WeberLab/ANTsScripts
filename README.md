# ANTs

ANTs is currently compiled on IceNine.  This is Bretta's computer, so please be respectful of that and do not use all the cores for ANTs.  If ANTs is getting significant useage and this becomes a problem, we will compile ANTs on another computer for people to use.



You can find instructions for using ANTs on IceNine (a medIT computer) or Amygdala (an MS-MRI computer) on specific pages in the wiki:

https://github.com/ubcmri/ANTs/wiki/ANTs-on-IceNine

https://github.com/ubcmri/ANTs/wiki/ANTs-on-Amygdala

This repo contains the IceNine scripts, Amydala is running a newer version of ANTs and so the scripts there have slight modifications to accomadate this. 


## ANTs Installation

For compiling and setting up ANTs on another computer, instructions for compiling ANTs can be found here:

https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS

and you will need to copy all of the .sh scripts from the ANTs source directory Scripts/ to the binary directory where antsRegistration etc are located.
