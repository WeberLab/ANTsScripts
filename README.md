## ANTs Installation

For compiling and setting up ANTs on another computer, instructions for compiling ANTs can be found here:

https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS

and you will need to copy all of the .sh scripts from the ANTs source directory Scripts/ to the binary directory where antsRegistration etc are located.

## BASH Scripts

This repo was forked from Adam Dvorak's repo on the UBC MRI Github.
Adam Dvorak (I believe) wrote most of these. Thanks Adam!
